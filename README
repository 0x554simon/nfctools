== NFC Tools for Java ==

NFCTools is a collection of libraries and tools for NFC in Java. 
The targeted devices are desktop Reader/Writer and Android smart phones. 

Most functions in the library have been tested with a 
Nexus S running ICS and a ACR 122 USB NFC dektop reader.

The NDEF tag functions work with Mifare classic 1K and 4K cards.
